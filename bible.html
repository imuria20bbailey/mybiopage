    <p>Jesus said this: Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; Knock, and it shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who knocks it shall be opened. or what man is there among you, when his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone? or if he shall ask for a fish,he will give him a snake, will he? if you then being evil,know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more  shall your Father whi is in Heaven give what is good to those who ask Him. mathew <em>7:7-11</em></p>
    <p>NOTE:<br> God will answer our prayers and give us everything we need and more<em>(mark 11:24).</em>But a wise parent will not give a child everything he or she wants. similarly, prayer is not a magical trick to get anything we want or a quick fix for problema that we should be solving ourselves. God answers prayer requests in His own way, in His own time. and He will not grant prayer requests that are against His Holy and wise purposes. requests that are slefish in nature, ones that are not in our long-term best interest, those that are made wiht impure motives. often we must be persistent in prayer. the answer, when it comes, may be in a form radically different than what we exoected, and we must be alert to that possibility. God frequently uses other people such as physicians, friends, relatives or new acquaintances, to supply an answer to our prayers. and sometimes the answer must come from within ourselves and persistant prayer will help us find that answer.we may need a new attitude or different way of looking at things.</p>

    <h2>HOW GOD SPEAKS TO US</h2>
    <p>God spoke directly to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Isaiah, Jesus and a few other people in the Bible. we all wish God would answer our prayers immediately and personally, but most of us will never hear Gods voice coming down from Heaven.<br> God does, however, speak to us through the Bible<em>(2 timothy 3:16-17)</em>it is our main source of knowledge about God and His will for our lives. We have the <em>Ten commandments,(exodus 20:1-17)</em>as a basis for everyday living. We have Jesus Great commandment."Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" and"Love your neigbor as yourself"<em>(mark 12:30-31)</em>as principles to guide every decision we make. we have Jesus sermon on mount to help us apply those principles to everyday life. to give us courage, strength and hope, we have Jesus assurance of enternal life for those who are faithful and obedient.</p>
